# Traditional finance has always relied on human intelligence to attempt to predict patterns within the market. 	
# While this used to be a skill that could only be attained through years of study using mathematics and statistical analysis, in the modern age, artificial intelligence has allowed us to gather information much quicker, and more accurately, than previous generations. 	
# IBM’s Watson AI is a perfect example of this.
# Watson has revolutionized the way businesses analyze and obtain important data. 
# IBM’s Watson AI studies company data, even down to jargon commonly used within the industry, and structures all of that data in order to help that business make more informed decisions. 
# With the help of machine learning, more specifically the Watson AI, a company is able to compress and comprehend the immense amount of data created, which allows that company to make an informed decision more efficiently.
# Watson is reshaping the landscape of many industries, including finance.
# This is mainly due to the fact that machine learning and AI is able to process information at a much higher rate than the human brain
# Watsons algorithms simplify and organize data in a way that, in previous generations, would require an entire department.
# IBM has several different areas that Watson can help businesses in. Including IT, advertising, risk and compliance, and financial operations. Watson uses building blocks it calls: dimensions, cubes and links.
# The basis is multidimensional cubes that allow data to be viewed from different perspectives and in different uses.
# Quoted directly from the IBM website, “For example, a regional manager might want to review data at a consolidated level, and a department manager might want to input the detailed data for their department. They use the same cube but see different views.”

# Many companies have used Watson to help reshape the way they handle their financial data. In a case study done on L’Oreal found on IBM’s website “We had a lot of local solutions from users with data crunching and manual entry,” says Laurent Mesnier, FP&A Information Systems Manager at L’Oreal, “but no ability to share the data with each other. We were lacking a common language on data and processes, which led to quality concerns.” To ensure sound governance and data accuracy, L’Oreal’s FP&A team made the business-critical decision to launch a single, centralized analytics platform built on solutions from IBM to serve more than 2,500 users worldwide.” - Stephanie Solomon, October 16, 2020

# IBM and their Watson AI are revolutionizing many aspects of business and the way the handle their data. As a result the world of business will soon rely on similar technologies to help them compartmentalize data within the individual infrastructure of that specific business.
